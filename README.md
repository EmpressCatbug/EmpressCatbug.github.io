# Takeria Thompson ePortfolio



## Overview

This repository documents my journey in developing my ePortfolio for the CS 499 Capstone as a final project. A professional portfolio is essential for showcasing my unique abilities and talents, serving as a vital tool to demonstrate my value to potential employers. The content represents a solid foundation to present my skills across key fields in Computer Software Engineering. The included artifacts highlight my growth in areas such as software design/engineering, algorithms and data structures, and database management.

Each artifact has been selected and enhanced to go beyond course requirements, ensuring a high quality of work that addresses limitations, inconsistencies, and potential vulnerabilities. This portfolio reflects my motivation, organization, and accomplishments as a Computer Software Engineering student.

## Journals

I will upload my reflective journals to GitHub, which include:

- **Self-Introduction**: An informative self-introduction related to Computer Software Engineering, discussing personal experiences and engagement with course concepts.
  You can read my self-introduction journal [here](https://github.com/Empresscatbug/EmpressCatbug.github.io/blob/main/CS%20499%206-1%20Journal%20Thompson.docx).
